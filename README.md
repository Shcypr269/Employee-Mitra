## Overview

The **Agentic Enterprise Assistant** is an enterprise-focused NLP system designed to go beyond traditional chatbots by combining:

- 📄 **Document-grounded Q&A using RAG**
- 🧠 **Agentic intent detection**
- ⚙️ **Enterprise action execution via structured JSON outputs**

It enables employees to:

- Ask factual questions from internal PDFs (e.g., annual reports, policies, SOPs)
- Receive page-level citations for traceability
- Trigger enterprise workflows through natural language

This system demonstrates how **Agentic RAG** can bridge the gap between knowledge retrieval and operational automation in enterprise environments.

---

## Problem Statement

Enterprises face two major challenges with AI assistants:

### Hallucination Risk

Traditional chatbots may generate confident but incorrect responses without grounding in enterprise data.

### Lack of Operational Capability

Most systems can answer questions but cannot trigger real enterprise actions like:

- Leave requests  
- IT tickets  
- Meeting scheduling  

As a result, employees still rely on fragmented portals and manual processes.

---

## Why This Project Stands Out

- ✅ Combines **RAG + Agentic reasoning**
- ✅ Produces **hallucination-safe answers with citations**
- ✅ Detects **user intent with confidence scoring**
- ✅ Outputs **structured JSON for enterprise automation**
- ✅ Designed with **enterprise workflows in mind**
- ✅ Clean **API-first architecture** for easy integration

💡 This project is not just a chatbot — it is a **decision-making assistant with execution capability**.

## Key Features

### 📄 Document Intelligence

- PDF ingestion pipeline
- Chunk-based retrieval with metadata
- Page-level citations

### 🧠 Agentic Reasoning

- Intent classification (Q&A vs Action)
- Confidence scoring
- Routing logic

### ⚙️ Enterprise Actions (Mock Integrations)

Supported actions include:

- `apply_leave`
- `schedule_meeting`
- `file_ticket`
- `request_software`
- `escalate_issue`
- `update_documentation`

⚠️ **Note:** Actions are executed via mock/stub handlers for hackathon demonstration. No real enterprise systems are connected.

### 🔐 Enterprise-Ready Design

- Environment-based configuration
- Dockerized deployment
- API-first design

## Traditional RAG vs Agentic RAG

| Feature | Traditional RAG | Agentic RAG (This Project) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Document grounding | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Citations | ⚠️ Optional | ✅ Mandatory |
| Intent detection | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Action execution | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Structured outputs | ❌ No | ✅ JSON schemas |
| Workflow automation | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Supported |
| Enterprise use cases | Limited | Strong fit |

## System Architecture

### Textual Flow

1. User sends query  
2. Agent layer evaluates intent  
3. If factual → RAG retrieval  
4. If operational → action routing  
5. LLM generates grounded response or structured JSON  
6. Final response returned with citations or action result  



## Tech Stack

| Backend | FastAPI, Uvicorn |
| Agent Framework | LangChain (lightweight usage) |

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow

#### 1. PDF Ingestion

- PDFs are parsed using PyPDF2  
- Text is chunked (~1000 chars, 200 overlap)  
- Embeddings are generated  
- Stored in FAISS vector index with page metadata  

#### 2. User Query Received

- Query sent to FastAPI endpoint  

#### 3. Intent Detection

- Keyword + scoring-based intent classifier  
- Determines:
  - Q&A intent
  - Action intent
  - Ambiguous (fallback to Q&A)

#### 4. Routing Logic

- If Q&A → Vector retrieval  
- If Action → Action schema selected  

#### 5. LLM Processing

- LLM receives:
  - Retrieved context (for RAG)
  - Or action schema (for structured output)

#### 6. Response Generation

- Factual answers include:
  - Extracted answer
  - Source page numbers  
- Actions return:
  - JSON with required parameters

#### 7. Action Execution (Mock)

- Action handler simulates enterprise response
